# ESP8266-SmartLighting
Cold/warm white balance for combo LED strips, with remote control, Google Home/Alexa integration and scheduling

TO DO:
- SLMessages implementation
- Scheduling and time sync (ex: after 11PM set warm white to 80%, cold white to 35%)
- Assistant Handler for simple commands (set warm/cold white to x %, turn off the lights...)
- Web interface with scheduler, live commands and configuration options for the time sync
- Decent login method
