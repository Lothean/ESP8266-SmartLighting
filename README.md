# ESP8266-SmartLighting
Cold/warm white balance for combo LED strips, with remote control, Google Home/Alexa integration and scheduling

TO DO:
- ~~SLMessages implementation~~ *Apart from small modifications, the instant messages are finished*
- Scheduling and time sync (ex: after 11PM set warm white to 80%, cold white to 35%) *Hum... yeah*
- Assistant Handler for simple commands (set warm/cold white to x %, turn off the lights...) *Easy part*
- ~~Web interface~~ with scheduler, live commands and configuration options for the time sync *Crappy web with no design*
- ~~Decent login method~~ *Login method finished, can still be bruteforced but ok for the moment*
